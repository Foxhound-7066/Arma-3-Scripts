Remember, -1 is driver, 0 is gunner, 0,0 is commander, 1 is extra seat 1. 2 is extra seat 2, and so on

helpme = _this weaponsTurret [0]; copyToClipboard str(helpme);        [this will copy all weapons assigned to that seat to your clipboard]

helpme = magazinesAllTurrets _this; copyToClipboard str(helpme);      [this will copy all ammo types assigned to that vehicle to your clipboard]

_this removeWeaponTurret ["", [0]];
_this addWeaponTurret ["", [0]];
_this addMagazineTurret ["",[0]];
